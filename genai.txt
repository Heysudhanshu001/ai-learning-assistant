GenAI stands for Generative Artificial Intelligence. It is a type of AI that can create new content instead of just analyzing or recognizing existing information.
This content can include:
* Text (like essays, stories, or answers)
* Images (like art or photos)
* Audio (like music or voice)
* Video
* Code
Generative AI works by learning patterns from large amounts of data and then using that knowledge to produce new outputs. For example, if a GenAI model is trained on millions of sentences, it can generate new sentences that sound natural and meaningful.
Some popular examples of Generative AI tools are:
* ChatGPT for text
* DALL-E or Midjourney for images
* GitHub Copilot for code
In short:
Generative AI is a technology that creates new content by learning from existing data.
