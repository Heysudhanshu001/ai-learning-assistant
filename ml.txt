ML stands for Machine Learning. It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence where machines learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed for every task.
Instead of writing fixed rules, we give the machine:
* Data
* Examples
* Patterns
And the machine learns how to make decisions or predictions.
For example, if we want a system to recognize whether an email is spam, we don’t give it specific rules. Instead, we provide many examples of spam and non-spam emails. The machine learns the difference and then predicts correctly for new emails.
Machine Learning is mainly divided into three types:
1. Supervised Learning
The model learns from labeled data (input with correct answers).
2. Unsupervised Learning
The model finds patterns in unlabeled data.
3. Reinforcement Learning
The model learns by trial and error and receives rewards or penalties.
In simple terms:
Machine Learning allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions automatically.
